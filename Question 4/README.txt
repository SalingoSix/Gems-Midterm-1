I've reduced the speed of the Tardis to about half, in order to give the orbs
a better shot at catching it at least once.

I also reduced the maze size to 101x101 to make it easier for the scan orbs
to catch the Tardis. They're not very bright. Hopefully you'll get a chance
to see them change colour when they're nearby the Tardis.
